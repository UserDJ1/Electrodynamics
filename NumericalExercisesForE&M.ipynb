    "### 3.5 Potential of a grounded conductor due to a nearby point charge - revisit the image charge solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Eqs (4) and (5) above are the potentials on any surface of radius R centered on the origin due to a point charge, either inside or outside the sphere.  Now if we have a grounded conducting sphere, V=0 on the surface. Let's say we have a positive charge outside the sphere. What happens is that negative charge comes in from ground and the surface acquires a negative charge density arranged to exactly cancel the potential due to the positive point charge outside. It turns out that this surface charge density creates a potential outside the sphere that looks just like a negative point charge inside! We solved this problem before using the Method of images, which seemed to rely on a \"guess\" that really wasn't obvious, but it seemed to do the trick. We can do the same problem in a more systematic way by finding the potential on the sphere due to the exterior charge, then find the potential on the sphere that would be required to produce V=0 on the surface. Then we will see that the induced surface charge density is exactly what a point charge inside the sphere would produce. We can do all of this by expansions in Legendre polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is general and can be used to find the potential for any distribution of exterior charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation** $V = V_{qa} + V_s$, where the total potential V is the sum of the potential due to the induced charge distribution on the sphere ($V_s$) and that due to the point charge q = qa at $r_o = a$. ($V_{qa}$). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_s(r, \\theta) = \\sum_\\ell^\\infty A_\\ell r^{\\ell} P_\\ell(\\cos\\theta).\\ \\  r  \\le R \\qquad(6)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_s(r, \\theta) = \\sum_\\ell^\\infty \\frac{B_\\ell}{r^{\\ell+1}} P_\\ell(\\cos\\theta).\\ \\  r \\ge R \\qquad(7)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential is continuous at r=R, so $B_\\ell = A_\\ell R^{2\\ell+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for a conductor, the total potential  $V = 0$ for r $\\le R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restate the problem:** What is the total potential due to a point charge $q_a$ at $\\vec{r_o} = a\\hat{z}$? Where a > R, so the charge is outside a conducting sphere of radius R.\n",
    "\n",
    "a)  First, ignore the fact that the sphere is a conductor for now, and just find the potential on the surface of the sphere due to the point charge qa outside. This potential is eq(4), call it $V_{qa}(R,\\theta)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "b) Next, impose the condition that the sphere is conducting, so V = 0 at r = R. The potential due to the induced charge on the sphere  is found by solving $\\nabla^2V_s = 0$, with $V_o(\\theta) = - V_{qa}(R,\\theta)$. This guarantees that V=0 at r=R.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already have the boundary condition expressed in terms of a Legendre series expansion, so we don't have to project the BC onto the $P_{\\ell}(cos\\theta)$ to find the $A_{\\ell}$ - we already have them from eqs.(4) and (5).\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The total potential for r > R is found by adding: $V(r,\\theta) = V_s(r,\\theta) + V_{qa}(r,\\theta)$. This  of course is the same as the potential found earlier using the method of images,because the solution is unique.  Also note that since V=0 on the surface of the conductor, we know that V=0 for $r \\le R$ (and E=0 inside). \n",
    "\n",
    "d) Again, because we know the solution V_s is unique, we want to show that the Legendre polynomial expansion for the potential $V_s(R,\\theta)$ on the sphere due to the exterior charge qa is the same as the potential due to the image charge qb inside, which is given by eq.(5). We know that the image charge is qb=- qa*R/a at $r_o = b = R^2/a$, so we'll find the potential on the surface due to this image charge. Of course the solution outside the sphere is uniquely determined by the boundary condition at r=R.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) But wait! In part d) we are using the $\\it{known}$ image charge. But what if we don't know that? The final step will be to show that the coefficients in the expansion of the potential due to the exterior charge qa allow us to find the image charge and its location within the sphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since E = 0 inside the sphere, we can find the induced surface charge density from $\\sigma(\\theta) = - \\epsilon_o \\frac{\\partial V_{out}}{\\partial r}$ at r=R, where $V = V(r,\\theta)$ for r > R. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default parameters for the charge outside the sphere and image charge are the \n",
    "same as those used for the image problem. "
